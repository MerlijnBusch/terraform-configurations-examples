### This file will contain the provider configuration and module declarations.

```
# AWS Provider Configuration
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Module Declarations
module "iam" {
  source = "./iam"
}
```


### Provider Configuration:

* The `provider aws` block specifies the AWS provider for the Terraform configuration. This allows Terraform to interact with AWS services. In this configuration, the provider is set to operate in the `us-west-2` region.

### Module Declarations:
* The module `iam` declaration defines a module named `iam`.
* Modules in Terraform allow you to organize and reuse your configurations.
* In this case, the module is sourced from the local `./iam` directory.
* This directory should contain the configuration for managing IAM resources.
