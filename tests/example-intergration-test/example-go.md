### an example of how you can write an integration test script using Terratest to conduct integration tests for Terraform modules:

```go
// filename: integration_test.go

package test

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

func TestTerraformIntegration(t *testing.T) {
    // Path to the Terraform directory containing the modules to test
    terraformOptions := &terraform.Options{
        TerraformDir: "path/to/your/terraform/modules",
    }

    // Run `terraform init` and `terraform apply` to deploy the Terraform modules
    terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)

    // Run tests to validate the behavior of the infrastructure
    // For example, you can test if certain resources are created and configured correctly
    // You can also use Terratest's helpers to query and verify the state of your infrastructure

    // For demonstration purposes, let's assume we are testing if an AWS EC2 instance is created
    instanceID := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "instance_id")
    assert.NotEmpty(t, instanceID, "EC2 instance ID should not be empty")

    // Clean up resources by running `terraform destroy`
    defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)
}
```

This integration test script uses Terratest to:

1. Deploy the Terraform modules located at the specified directory.
2. Run tests to validate the behavior of the deployed infrastructure. This could involve verifying if resources are created, configured correctly, or interact with each other as expected.
3. Clean up resources by running `terraform.Destroy` after the tests are completed.

To run this test, make sure you have Go installed and then run:

```shell
go test -v integration_test.go
```
